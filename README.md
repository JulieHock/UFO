## Overview of Project

The purpose of this analysis is to allows easy filtering of UFO data to a specific date, city, state, country or shape.  This will allow people to not have to sift through thousands of rows of data, but rather just look at the criteria they are ineterested in.  This will help people quickly find information, that might otherwise take hours to find.

Results

The website is very easy to use now, where anyone can visit the site and select how filtered they may want their data.  Below the introduction is the search filters, with the table to the right.

A person filters, the table will automatically filter the data to meet the search.  A person could refine the search by one filter, up to all filters.  If there are no resutls based on the filters, the table will be blank.

So, if someone wanted to know about UFO sightings on 1/10/2010 in California, they would type in the date (using only a single digit for months and days if applicable) and then type in ca for the state.  We can see from the table that there were two resutls that matched that criteria.
